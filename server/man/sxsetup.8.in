.SH NAME
sxsetup \- configure and display information about an SX node
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sxsetup
[\fI\,OPTIONS\/\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
With sxsetup one can interactively or automatically configure an SX node and join it to a cluster, as well as display information about a local node.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Print help and exit
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Print version and exit
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-info\fR
Show information and configuration of a local node, including current disk usage.
.TP
\fB\-\-upgrade\fR
Upgrade local storage format and cluster databases to the latest version. This option should be used after upgrading the node to the latest software version, to make use of the new features and improvements.
.TP
\fB\-\-config\-file\fR \fI\,FILE\/\fR
Use config file to configure the node automatically.
.TP
\fB\-\-advanced\fR
Enable advanced configuration options. With this option one can configure additional options such as port numbers, SSL certificate settings, or number of workers. It is also required to configure a node as a regular user instead of root.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-remote\-copy\fR
By default, sxsetup will create a remote volume "_sxsetup.conf" on the cluster and upload the node configuration into it. When joining a new node to the cluster, it will look for existing configurations and try to obtain some information (such as an SSL certificate) automatically, to limit the number of questions in the interactive mode. With this option no remote copy will be created.
.TP
\fB\-\-bare\fR
Create a bare (unprogrammed) node. A bare node is ready to join a cluster. Multiple bare nodes can be joined to the cluster at once, to minimize time of the rebalance process.
.TP
\fB\-\-force\-reinit\fR
With this option one can reconfigure an existing node.
.TP
\fB\-\-new\-ip\fR \fI\,IPaddr[/internalIPaddr]\/\fR
Change the existing IP address(es) of the node. sxsetup will update the local configuration and inform the cluster about the changes. In case of problems, the original configuration will be restored.
.TP
\fB\-\-check\fR
Perform the integrity check of the local storage. The process might take more time, depending on the size of the data. The node will be offline during the check.
.TP
\fB\-\-compact\fR
This option will compact the node's data to release unused space to the system, see \fBsxadm-node\fR(1) for more information. The node will be offline during the process.
.TP
\fB\-\-deactivate\fR
This option will relocate all data stored on this node to other nodes in the cluster and deactivate the node. The procedure can take more time depending on the data size and the network speed. When it's finished, the node will no longer be a member of the cluster. The local storage of the node is not deleted.
.TP
\fB\-\-wait\fR
When a new node is added to a cluster, an automatic data rebalance process gets started. During the rebalance, cluster works in read-write mode but no changes to the cluster structure (eg. adding or removing nodes) are allowed. With this option sxsetup will wait until the rebalance is finished.
.TP
\fB\-\-debug\fR
Turn on debug mode for the created node. This will result in a large amount of log files.
