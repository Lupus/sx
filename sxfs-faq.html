                    <p>Network filesystems allow you to mount a remote directory living on a remote server onto your local PC. SXFS stores your data in Skylable SX, a fault-tolerant, secure distributed object storage.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li id="how-is-sxfs-different-from-s3fs-s3fuse-s3ql-and-similar-products">
                    <p>With S3FS, S3QL and other similar filesystem mapping for S3 buckets, appending to a file requires rewriting the whole file. If you have to append 1 byte to a 1TB file, S3FS and S3QL will upload one whole terabyte of data again.</p>
                    <p>SXFS is smarter: it only transfers differences between files.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li id="how-is-sxfs-different-from-amazon-efs">
                    <p>Access to Amazon EFS is restricted to Amazon EC2 instances in the same region. SXFS allows you to build a truly global shared filesystem with fault tolerance and virtually unlimited size which can be accessed anywhere in the world.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li id="how-is-sxfs-different-from-dropbox-box-and-onedrive">
                    <p>SXFS is a live filesystem, where any update is immediately visible to all sharers. It is completely open-source, and released under the GPL2 licence.</p>
                    <p>Dropbox, Box and OneDrive are closed source, proprietary software which can be remotely updated by the vendor without your intervention. They are file-sharing oriented, and adopt a syncing filesystem approach. In a syncing filesystem, all data is continuosly propagated across all clients, updates are synchronized in background. In SXFS data is downloaded on demand, only when you need it.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li id="how-is-sxfs-different-from-sxdrive-for-desktop">
                    <p>SXDrive for Desktop is a file syncing client for Windows/OSX/Linux. It keeps a local copy of all files synchronized across multiple PCs. With SXFS data is fetched on demand, so you can read and store more data than your local storage.</p>

                  <li id="does-sxfs-protect-my-data-from-corruption-bit-rot-detection">
                    <p>Yes, SXFS supports client-side encryption and end-to-end data integrity checks.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li id="does-sxfs-protect-me-from-accidentally-overwriting-my-data">
                    <p>If you enable "revisions", everytime you overwrite a file in SXFS the storage backend will store the previous version of that file and will make it available for later retrieval (up to a certain configurable limit) through the ''sxrev'' tool. Storing multiple revisions of the same file doesn't take much additional space and bandwidth because only differences between files are transferred and stored on SX, the storage backend.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li id="does-sxfs-protect-me-from-data-leaks">
                    <p>If somebody compromises your server, with other network filesystems your data is leaked. SXFS optionally encrypts your data, including filenames, on the client-side, before it is uploaded to the server. If someone access your server, he will only see unintelligible data.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li id="what-is-the-maximum-size-of-sxfs">
                    <p>SXFS gives you virtually unlimited storage for your files. With other solutions, like NFS, Samba/CIFS and sshfs, when you run out of space you must move some data to another server or upgrade your server. At some point you always hit the physical limits of the server.</p>
                    <p>SXFS dynamically grows to fit your needs: when a server is full, all you need to do is setup a new SX node and join it to the SX cluster. The additional space becomes immediately available and data is rebalanced in background to make disk usage even across all nodes.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li id="what-is-the-maximum-size-of-a-file-stored-in-sxfs">
                    <p>SX can store files of virtually any size. SXFS depends on FUSE and therefore is limited by the maximum file size supported by FUSE (it depends on the filesystem in which a temporary directory is located).</p>
                  </li>
                  <li id="is-sxfs-firewall-friendly-and-safe-to-use-over-the-internet">
                    <p>Most network filesystems require the admin to poke holes in the firewall or to add special NAT rules. Often they are not designed to be used over unsecure connections or environments and require a dedicated and isolated network.</p>
                    <p>In the case of SXFS and SX the entire protocol is stateless and tunnelled over HTTPS to make it both secure and firewall friendly. It will cross any NAT and RFC compliant web proxies without a glitch.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li id="how-does-sxfs-optimize-disk-space-and-bandwidth-usage">
                    <p>SXFS encrypts files using a cryptographically secure algorithm, AES 256 in the CBC mode. Each block of a file is encrypted and an HMAC checksum is stored in order to provide data integrity. If some blocks of data of a new file are already stored in the SX storage backend, they are automatically identified and only their hash is transferred, saving both bandwidth and disk space.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li id="how-fast-is-sxfs">
                    <p>SXFS transfers only differences between files, and has a local caching mechanism to avoid transferring the data accessed most frequently multiple times. SXFS is optimized for fast read access to files: it will download and upload data using multiple SX nodes in parallel. This is a big advantage over solutions like NFS, Samba/CIFS and sshfs, s3fs, S3QL, which are limited by the speed of a single server or endpoint.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li id="is-sxfs-suitable-for-a-geographically-distributed-environment">
                    <p>Yes, it is. SX, the storage backend, is specifically designed to run in a geographically distributed environment. You can group SX nodes located in a specific region/datacenter together by creating multiple zones. Your data is then replicated across all zones. SXFS clients will fetch the data from the nearest zone and fall back on the other zones in case the nearest zone experiences an outage.</p>
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <h4 class="faq-content-header">Use cases</h4>
                <ol class="faq-answers">
                  <li id="what-are-some-common-use-cases-for-sxfs">
                    <p>SXFS is best suited for securely sharing data across many servers in a geographically distributed environment. This includes building fully redundant infrastructures for serving web apps without any SPoF, fault-tolerant storage</p>
                  </li>
                  <li id="can-i-use-sxfs-with-wordPress-drupal-joomla-magento-and-other-cms">
                    <p>Yes, SXFS is a great fit to build highly scalable web infrastructures to run your favourite CMS or any other web app. You can easily share file assets among your frontend and backend servers and update them from a single location. You will mount SXFS as the webroot of your web app, and the webservers will all read and write the same file assets.</p>
                    <p>This makes keeping the website synchronized across the whole infrastructure much easier.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li id="is-it-free">Is it free?
                    <p>Yes, both SXFS and SX are free and released under the GPL2 licence. You can self-host SX on your own commodity servers and use SXFS at no additional cost. There are no storage or licence fees.</p>
                  </li>

                  <li id="is-it-open-source">
                    <p>Yes, both client (SXFS) and server (SX) are open-source and released under the GPL2 licence.</p>

                    <p>SXFS optionally encrypts your files locally before they are uploaded to SX. The encrypted data is sent directly to SX and stays encrypted until it returns to the machine running SXFS. Nobody but you can access your files.</p>

                    <p>We have been developing open-source software since 2002: we are in it for the long haul. In the extremely unlikely event that we cease maintaing SX and SXFS, anyone can pick up their development This is the advantage of releasing the software as GPL. The same cannot be said about proprietary software, which would quickly become obsolete and stop working, with none left to develop it and no access to source code. History is full of episodes of SaaS companies going out of business and forcing their customers to switch to another service (copy.com, the swiss one, etc) and migrate all their data. With SX and SXFS *you* are in control, and nobody else: you can self-host your storage backend on your own servers with minimal effort.</p>

                  <li id="which-platforms-does-sxfs-support">
                    <p>SXFS depends on FUSE, and will run on any platform supported by FUSE. SXFS and SX are already included in Fedora, Ubuntu and Debian. Binary packages for other distributions are available from our "repositories". MacOSX users must install osxfuse from "MacPorts" and compile SXFS from source.</p>

                    <p>The only way to access data on Windows is to use our free Qt/C++ application "SXDrive for Windows". Supporting SXFS on Windows would require rewriting a lot of code because SXFS depends on FUSE and there is no FUSE for Windows. If you would like to see a Windows version of SXFS, let us know.</p>
