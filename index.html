              <p>SX Cluster is a reliable, fully distributed cluster solution for your data storage needs, released under the GPL licence. With SX Cluster you aggregate the disk space available on multiple servers and merge it into a single storage system. The cluster makes sure that your data is always replicated over multiple nodes (the exact number of copies is defined by the sysadmin) and synchronized. Additionally, SX Cluster has built-in support for high-availability, bit rot detection, deduplication, client-side encryption, on-the-fly compression and much more.</p><a href="support.html" class="btn btn-primary">Support</a> <a href="sxfs.html" class="btn btn-warning">SXFS</a>

              <p class="features__description">If your users upload 10 copies of the same data, that data takes the same space as 1 copy. If you upload 10 files which differ only for a few bytes, only the differences between the files take up additional space, the rest is deduplicated.</p>

              <p class="features__description">Never transfer the same data twice. The SX protocol transfers only the differences between the local copy of a file and the data already stored in the cluster. Additionally, it transfers data to/from all SX nodes in parallel to maximize speed.</p>

              <p class="features__description">Your data is safe by default. Server-to-server and client-to-server communications are securely encrypted by default. Additionally SX supports client-side encryption, which ensures that your data cannot be read by the sysadmin of the cluster.</p>

              <p class="features__description">By default, data is distributed evenly across all the nodes in the cluster: if you want to achieve redundancy across two or more racks of servers, or across two or more datacenter, partition your cluster in multiple zones.</p>
